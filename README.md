# C++ is "C with Classes"

The goal of these modules is to introduce you to Object-Oriented Programming.
This will be the starting point of your C++ journey.
Many languages are recommended to learn OOP.

## Cpp 00 :

### Namespace :
  A namespace is a feature that allows you to organize and encapsulate code into logical groups
Namespace provide the space where we can define or declare identifier i.e. variable,method, classes.

- stdio streams : Standard Input / Output Streams Library (iostream)
- cin : Standard input stream (object)
- cout : Standard output stream (object)
- cerr : Standard output stream for errors (object)
- clog : Standard output stream for logging (object)
- WRITE : the stream insertion operator (<<)
- READ : the stream extraction operator (>>)

### scope resolution operator “::” 
  Here std is used in front of cin and cout along with scope resolution operator, which indicates that the object cin and cout are defined inside the namespace whose name is std. The std is the standard library, and both cin and cout are defined inside this scope.
